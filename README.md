# React Assignement

##### First I started with initializing the repository that will hold the app,

##### I used vite since it is the recomended way to create new react app.

##### Then I configured react testing library with vitest , linting rules with eslint and airbnb guidelines, formating with prettier.

##### I started creating the first UI layoutes and components using ant design library , used redux for state management.

##### Then I started writing the logic used for authentication and request call using axios, writing the logic for adding single todo, edit , delete and filter the list of todos.
